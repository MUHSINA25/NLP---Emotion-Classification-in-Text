# NLP---Emotion-Classification-in-Text

This project focuses on classifying text comments into emotions using machine learning. It includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, and the application of both Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes models.

## Project Overview

- **Data Preprocessing:** Lowercasing, removal of short words, punctuation, tokenization, and stopword removal.
- **Feature Extraction:**
  - **Count Vectorization:** Creates a matrix of word counts.
  - **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Weighs words based on their importance.
- **Models:**
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Achieved 90% accuracy.
  - **Naive Bayes:** Achieved 89% accuracy.
